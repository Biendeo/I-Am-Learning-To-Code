I Am Learning To Code!
=================

Follow me along in my adventures of learning how to write code! I'll be doing random stuff mostly, but feel free to suggest simple stuff that I may be able to do.

Also, help me out along the way. If I'm stumped on anything, tell me how to correct stuff!

I also want this to be as neat as possible, and to be nicely commented so that when I and anyone else looks back on it, we know what's going on.
