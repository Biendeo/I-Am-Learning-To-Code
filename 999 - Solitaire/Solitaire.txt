Firstly, randomise the deck.
	This can be done by setting a variable that will equal 52 (call it maxRandom).
	Also, set another variable that will store the number generated. By storing it as an int, it doesn't have the decimal we'll call it randomStore.
	Then, make a random number between 0 and maxRandom, and store it in randomStore.
