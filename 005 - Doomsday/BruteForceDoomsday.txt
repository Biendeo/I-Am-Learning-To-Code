	If (day = 32 || month < 12),
		Change day back to 1, and up the month.
	
	If (day = 29 || month = 2 || isitLeapYear = FALSE),

	If (day = 30 || month = 2 || isItLeapYear = TRUE),
		Change day back to 1, and up the month.
		
	If (day = 31 || month = 4, 6, 9, 11),
		Change day back to 1, and up the month.
