MainGame.c
	Includes most of the logic that the game uses to compute stuff.
	
	That huge game struct
		Make two smaller structs called playerData (name them p1 and p2). They'll have player-specific data.
		This will mean calling the data will be, gameData.p1.money, etc.
		Current turn
		Unit tracking (an array of struct units (let's say 100)). They'll have unit-specific data.
		Map data (stored as a 2D array of ints (maybe chars))
			This should just note what the map layout is.
		Building data
			This needs to track what current "health" each building is at, and who owns it. The type of building should be told by the map data.
			This is probably an array of structs again. Fortunately, buildings are never destroyed, so the list ordering doesn't matter.
		Cursor position
			Convenient for when you enter a menu and you want to back out.
			I think this should be reset between turns.
			There also needs to be a system that prevents the cursor from moving out of the playing field.

		Money
		Buildings owned
		Current units
	
FileIO.c
	Loads the map data, and handles save and load data.
	
	mapLoad
		Reads a text file and loads the map data.
	
	saveGame
	
	
	loadGame
		Similar to saveGame but it loads the save file
	
GameUI.c
	A simpler file that calls upon most of the functions.
	
GameAI.c
	An AI that similarly uses the GameUI.c rules but computes some things based on that data. It should have access to the more specific parts.
	
drawingUI.c
	A file that does the screen drawing.
	It needs to figure out how
	
UI design
	The map should occupy a portion of the screen. Underneath is the menus.
	The only thing extra that should be drawn on the map is the cursor (and any units).
	The menus should display what the cursor has highlighted (both unit and tile).
	When a key is pressed (hopefully arrow keys and space will work), then the cursor will move.
