THY DUNGEONMAN

YOU ARE THY DUNGEONMAN!

Ye find yeself in yon dungeon. Ye see a SCROLL. Behind ye SCROLL is a FLASK. Obvious exits are NORTH, SOUTH, and DENNIS. What woulst thou deau?

asd (and anything else)

That does not computeth. Type HELP is thou needs of it.

help (look also works)

Ye find yeself in yon dungeon. Ye see a SCROLL. Behind ye SCROLL is a FLASK. Obvious exits are NORTH, SOUTH, and DENNIS. What woulst thou deau?

get flask

Ye cannot get the FLASK. It is firmly bolted to a wall which is bolted to the rest of the dungeon which is probably bolted to a castle. Never you mind.

get scroll

Ye takes the SCROLL and reads of it. It doth say:

BEWARE, READER OF YE SCROLL, DANGERS AWAIT TO THE -

The SCROLL disappears in thy hands with ye olde ZAP!

get scroll

Ye doth suffer from memory loss. YE SCROLL is no more. Honestly.

get scrol

Thou cannotst get that. Quit making stuffeth up!

north (go north also works)

You go NORTH through yon corridor. You arrive at parapets. Ye see a ROPE. Obvious exits are SOUTH.

get rope (take rope)

You attempt to take ye ROPE but alas it is enchanted! It glows a mustard red and smells like a public privy. The ROPE wraps round your neck and hangs you from parapets. With your last breath, you wonder what parapets are.
Your score was: 1

(jump to 54)

look rope

It looks okay. You've seen better.

look room (anything that isn't defined)

It looketh pretty awesome.

look flask

Looks like you could quaff some serious mead out of that thing.

look scroll

Parchment, definitely parchment. I'd recognize it anywhere.

south

You head south to an embankment. Or maybe a chasm. You can't decide which. Anyway, ye spies a TRINKET. Obvious exits are NORTH.

look trinket

Quit looking! Just get it already.

get trinket

Ye getsts yon TRINKET and discover it to be a bauble. You rejoice at your good fortune. You shove the TRINKET in your pouchel. It kinda hurts.

get trinket (already have it)

Sigh. The trinket is in thou pouchel. Recallest thou?

look trinket

Just a bulge in thou pouchel at thist point.

go dennis

Ye arrive at Dennis. He wears a sporty frock coat and a long jimberjam. He paces about nervously. Obvious exits are NOT DENNIS.

give trinket

A novel idea! You givst the TRINKET to Dennis and he happily agrees to tell you what parapets are. With this new knowledge, ye escapes from yon dungeon in order to search for new dungeons and to remain...

THY DUNGEONMAN!!
You hath won! Congraturation!
Your score was: 2

talk dennis

You engage Dennis in lesiurely discussion. Ye learns that his jimberham was purchased on sale at a discount market and that he enjoys pacing about nervously. You become bored and begin thinking about parapets.

die

That wasn't very smart.
Your score was: -100

Play again? [Y/N]

look parapets
Well, they're parapets. This much we know for sure.

At south
look
Ye stand high above a canyon-like depression. Obvious exits are NORTH.
