/*
 * A C++ calculator by Thomas Moffet
 * Started on 23/07/2015
 * 
 * The goal of this is to:
 * 1. Make a working calculator that computes several basic functions.
 * 2. Experiment using C++ classes in a proper context.
 * 3. Look good for uni points. :)
 * 
 * There is more info in the Plan.txt file provided.
 *
 * You can freely use this for whatever you want. :)
