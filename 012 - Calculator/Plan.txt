CALCULATOR PLAN

What will this calculator do?
    Allow the user to type a math equation.
    Have the computer evaluate that equation.

How will it do that?
    The computer will need to firstly scan the entire string, and count the
    brackets. This should allow it to find the greatest degree of bracket in the
    equation. Ties should be okay.
    Then, knowing the greatest degree of bracket, run through the string again.
    FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO THIS BEFORE YOU START DOING CODE!

What operands will it do?
    Addition
    Subtraction
    Multiplication
    Division
    Powers
    Modulus
    
    This stuff for stretch
        Trigonometric functions
        Variables?
        Constants (e, pi, Avagadro's, etc.)
        Imaginary numbers

What else will it have?
    You'll be able to get the values of previous results and call them later.

Functions (think broad and separate them down)
    main
        Should firstly test to see if the program works (testComputations()).
        Then will go into the normal mode (calculatorMode()).
    
    testComputations
        This will test that the calculations work properly. This should just
        call computeString() on some set things.

    calculatorMode
        This will call a few functions for the regular operation of the program.

    equationInput
        This should ask for user input. This should only relate to doing
        equations. There will be other parts of the program that will just use
        their own input.

    validityCheck
        This should scan the return of equationInput() and check if everything
        is proper. If it's not proper, the program should then ask
        equationInput() again.
